    <h2>What is Quishing?</h2>
    <p>Quishing is a form of phishing that uses QR codes to trick users into visiting malicious websites or downloading harmful software. Attackers embed malicious links within a QR code, and when scanned, it can lead the user to a fraudulent website designed to steal personal information or distribute malware.</p>

    <h2>How Quishing Works</h2>
    <p>Quishing attacks typically involve a QR code that is placed in an email, physical location, or even a website. When the QR code is scanned by a victim, it redirects to a phishing website or downloads malicious content. Often, these codes are placed on legitimate materials like flyers or posters, making them seem trustworthy.</p>

    <h2>Common Examples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fake promotional offers that lead to malicious websites.</li>
        <li>QR codes on restaurant menus that redirect to phishing pages.</li>
        <li>Fake delivery or shipment notifications containing QR codes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>
    <p>To avoid falling victim to quishing, always be cautious when scanning QR codes from unknown or unexpected sources. Here are some best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verify the source of the QR code before scanning.</li>
        <li>Use a QR code scanner that checks the link destination before visiting it.</li>
        <li>Be wary of QR codes in unsolicited emails or on suspicious websites.</li>
    </ul>
